# CDSD: Chinese Dysarthria Speech Database

## Abstractï¼š
We present the Chinese Dysarthria Speech Database (CDSD) as a valuable resource for dysarthria research. This database comprises speech data from 24 participants with dysarthria. Among these participants, one recorded an additional 10 hours of speech data, while each recorded one hour, resulting in 34 hours of speech material. To accommodate participants with varying cognitive levels, our text pool primarily consists of content from the AISHELL-1 dataset and speeches by primary and secondary school students. When participants read these texts, they must use a mobile device or the ZOOM F8n multi-track field recorder to record their speeches. In this paper, we elucidate the data collection and annotation processes and present an approach for establishing a baseline for dysarthric speech recognition. Furthermore, we conducted a speaker-dependent dysarthric speech recognition experiment using an additional 10 hours of speech data from one of our participants. Our research findings indicate that, through extensive data-driven model training, fine-tuning limited quantities of specific individual data yields commendable results in speaker-dependent dysarthric speech recognition. However, we observe significant variations in recognition results among different dysarthric speakers. These insights provide valuable reference points for speaker-dependent dysarthric speech recognition.
