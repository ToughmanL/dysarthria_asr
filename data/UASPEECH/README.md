# Dysarthric speech database for universal access research

## Abstract
This paper describes a database of dysarthric speech produced by 19 speakers with cerebral palsy. Speech materials consist of 765 isolated words per speaker: 300 distinct uncommon words and 3 repetitions of digits, computer commands, radio alphabet and common words. Data is recorded through an 8-microphone array and one digital video camera. Our database provides a fundamental resource for automatic speech recognition development for people with neuromotor disability. Research on articulation errors in dysarthria will benefit clinical treatments and contribute to our knowledge of neuromotor mechanisms in speech production. Data files are available via secure ftp upon request.
